# MarkovDecisionProblems
Java program for computing Markov decision problems solution for an agent on a two-dimensional map. The example maps are in files: map1.txt, map2.txt and map3.txt.

Steps to create the example map:
number_of_columns number_of_rows
probability_of_going_left probability_of_going_forward probability_of_going_right
reward_for_normal_states
discounting factor

map(N-normal_states, F-prohibited_states, S-start_state, T-terminal_states, B-special_states)
